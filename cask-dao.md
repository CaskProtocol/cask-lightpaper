# Cask DAO

The Cask protocol operates as a DAO and generates fees to pay member rewards as well as fund operations and expansion. The Cask Protocolâ€™s native token is the **CASK** token. This token is used to govern the protocol, offer discounts to providers who stake as well as distribute rewards to stakers and liquidity providers.

## Governance <a href="#_8kzti3j2oavc" id="_8kzti3j2oavc"></a>

During the initial launch of the protocol, the DAO will be governed by a multi-sig wallet held by the founding team. Governance will be transitioned to governance token stakers over time as governance and decision making directly affects participants of the network.

Once governance is transferred to the DAO, voting will use the gasless snapshot tool with voting weight calculated based on unvested tokens and staked governance tokens on the Ethereum mainnet.

The following are some of the actions that are managed by the governance process:

* Smart contract upgrades
* Change ENS/IPNS to point to new hash for app upgrades
* Change ENS/IPNS to point to new hash for subscription widget upgrades
* Set whitelisted ERC-20 tokens allowed to be used for payments and payouts
* Mange yield strategies for protocol TVL (minus the reserve balance)
* Set the Base Asset stablecoin of the protocol
* Allocate treasury funds
* Elect multi-sig members
* Token burns
* Emergency shutdown

The following are protocol-level parameters that can be adjusted via governance:

* **Base Fees**: Payment fees (both fixed fee and percentage) taken from provider payout if staking no CASK.
* **Stake Target Factor**: Target number of CASK a provider should stake per subscriber per payment if they want to pay no fee for the transaction.
* **Token Distribution**: Percentage distribution of CASK rewards between liquidity providers, governance stakers and consumer/provider rewards.
* **Yield Performance Fee**: APR percentage subtracted from yield generation income before passing through yield strategy income to consumers and providers. This revenue is used to help pay for protocol operation.
* **Claim Reserve Factor**: The multiple of assets to keep on hand in the protocol to pay unclaimed provider balances, with the remainder of the balance delegated to the yield strategies.

The **CASK** token is used to govern the protocol, offer discounts to providers, and distribute profits generated by the protocol. Providers who stake their CASK tokens are given a discount on protocol fees as detailed in the Protocol Fees section.
