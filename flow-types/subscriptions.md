# NFT Subscriptions

The NFT subscription flow implements a recurring payment agreement between a consumer and a service provider. The service
provider can be a traditional web2/SaaS type business or could also be any creator, community, impact DAO or project
that sustains via a recurring flow of funds from its members. Subscriptions are represented as an NFT in the consumers
wallet and many of the properties of the NFT can be customized. Providers can also configure the NFT to be limited and
transferrable which opens up unique web3 economic opportunities.

Service providers configure one or more plans with a specific interval, price, optional free trial period, and a number
of other settings. It is also possible to create several types of discounts. Traditional discount codes are supported in
addition to web3-native discounts that can be offered to consumers holding a specific balance of an ERC20 token or an NFT
from a specific collection.
