### Multi Chain:

The Cask protocol has been deployed on a number of EVM chains, and additional chains will be supported in the future. For the
checkout widget to support multiple chains, the provider must have deployed the exact same set of plans/discounts on each
chain in which they support. Once that is done, the widget needs to be told which chains to support via the `chains`
attribute. The value is a comma separate list of the following chains:

Production Environment:
* polygon
* avalanche
* fantom
* celo
* aurora
* moonbeam
* gnosis

Testnet Environment:
* mumbai
* fuji
* celo_alfajores


### Styling:

`cask-checkout-button` uses [Shadow CSS ::part](https://github.com/fergald/docs/blob/master/explainers/css-shadow-parts-1.md) spec. It has button inside defined as `button` part
![img.png](docs/button_part.png)

```html
<style>
    .cask-checkout-button::part(button) {
        background-color: aqua;
        width: 100%; /* Those styles apply to button in shadow root */
    }
</style>
<cask-checkout-button
        class="cask-checkout-button"
        label="Pay with Crypto"
/>
```
