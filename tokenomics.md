# Tokenomics

## Token and Staking (coming soon)

The **CASK** token will be used to govern the protocol, offer discounts on certain flow types, and reward those holding balances in
the protocol.

There are two staking options for CASK holders:

**Governance Staking** - CASK holders who stake their CASK into the governance staking contract will be able to propose
and vote on DAO proposals and other governance activities as outlined above.

**Fee-Reduction Staking** - Some flows offer fee reduction to those who [stake](/protocol-fees.md#fee-reduction-staking) their CASK tokens.
One example is service providers using the [subscriptions](/flow-types/subscriptions.md) flow are given a discount on the payment fee.

## Supply

* Initial Circulating Supply: 130,000,000
* Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
