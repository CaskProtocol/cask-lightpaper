# Staking Rewards

![](.gitbook/assets/cask\_emissions.png)

There are two sources of tokens which are used in distributions:

**Staking Rewards Pool** - These come from the rewards pool set aside during the protocol creation and are used to kickstart the protocol over a period of 5 years. After this pool is depleted, only rewards bought from protocol income will be distributed.

**Buybacks** - The protocol periodically buys back CASK tokens using stablecoin income generated from protocol use. The bought back tokens will be subject to governance directives, but it is expected they will be used for rewards, gas subsidies and for protocol owned liquidity.

Tokens are distributed initially as follows but can be updated via governance proposals, notably as the early incentive pool runs out:

* 35% to liquidity providers of the various LP pools. The distribution weight of rewards to the LPs is dynamic and set based on the previous week fee income from the various ERC-20 tokens, ie, if the protocol earns twice as much DAI than USDC in a week, the CASK/DAI LP pool will receive twice the rewards of the CASK/USDC LP.
* 25% to holders who have staked for governance, distributed in proportion to the amount of CASK staked.
* 20% to providers who are staking CASK tokens for fee discounts, distributed in proportion to the amount of CASK staked.
* 20% to consumers distributed in proportion to their deposited funds balance.
